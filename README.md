# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-
This project is about Facial Emotion Recognition using AI techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks and Haar-Cascade etc..

<p align="justify"> The goal of this project is to create a reliable system for facial emotion identification by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a 19,502 photos of Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER2013) dataset. PyTorch and TensorFlow integration made it easier to construct models quickly, and the Adam optimizer guaranteed that training would always result in the best possible convergence. The accuracy and speed of emotion recognition were further improved by utilizing the Haar-cascade algorithm in a real-time detection system. After 100 epochs, each with 98 samples, the suggested methodology attained an amazing accuracy of 84%, proving the methodâ€™s effectiveness.</p>
